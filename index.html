                <p>Hello, my name is Luz Maria Vigil. I am fortunate to be a mother of three amazing and loving kiddos. I have been a stay at home mom for a while now and while I have loved being able to be home with my children, I am ready to go back to work. I am new to coding, but I am truly enjoying everything I am learning.</p>

                <p>Some of the things I like to do are traveling, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, reading and spending time with my family. Other sports I enjoy playing, but haven't had time in a while are tennis and volleyball.</p>

                <p>I really look forward to learning more about programming. It is amazing to see all the things that can be created with the different programming languages.</p>
